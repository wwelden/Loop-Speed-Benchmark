# Binary Search Implementations

This repository contains binary search implementations in various programming languages. Each implementation includes:
- The binary search algorithm
- Test cases
- Example usage

## Languages Included
- Rust
- Go
- Zig
- JavaScript (JS)
- TypeScript (TS)
- Python
- Java
- C
- C++
- Haskell
- C#
- Assembly (x86_64)
- Swift
- Lua
- Scala
- Bash
- PHP
- Kotlin
- Perl

## Project Structure
Each language implementation is in its own directory with the following structure:
```
language_name/
├── src/
│   └── binary_search.*
├── tests/
│   └── binary_search_test.*
└── README.md
```

## Running the Implementations

Each language directory contains specific instructions for running the implementation. Please refer to the individual README files in each language directory.

## Algorithm Description
Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and eliminates half of the remaining elements in each step.

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

## Test Cases
Each implementation includes test cases for:
- Target value present in the array
- Target value not present in the array
- Empty array
- Single element array
- Target value at the beginning of the array
- Target value at the end of the array
